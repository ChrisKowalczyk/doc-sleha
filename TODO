README for things to do after SP2


* Chapter "Configuring and Manager Cluster Resources (Command Line)
  Merge example in section id=sec.ha.manual_config.example with 
  Tanja's HA Quick Start

* Examples in appendix: what do do? Should we move/remove it and
  create a new examples guide? 
  We should make sure, examples are consistent (naming, resources, etc.)
