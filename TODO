README for things to do after SP2

* Chapter "Configuring and Manager Cluster Resources (Command Line)
  Merge example in section id=sec.ha.manual_config.example with 
  Tanja's HA Quick Start

* Examples in appendix: what do do? Should we move/remove it and
  create a new examples guide? 
  We should make sure, examples are consistent (naming, resources, etc.)

* transform SVGs to SUSE style

* get more input for LVS chapter to turn it into something more useful

* NodeUtilization RA now moved to Pacemaker (ha_config_basics.xml), reflect utilization 
  changes in ha_config_cli.xml

* explain concept of resource sets

* extend troubleshooting chapter (dmuhamedagic's troubleshooting guide), 
  ask NTS for 10 most common errors that can easily be avoided

* add new terms to ha_glossary.xml

* integrate remaining Hawk feedback by tserong, catch up with Hawk development

* extend DTD to allow list of authors & contributors

* adjust ha_config_example.xml to Hawk wizard output for OCFS2, feedback by vpelcak)
