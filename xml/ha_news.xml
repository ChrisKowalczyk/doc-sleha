  <remark>taroth 2010-01-26: todo: add new section for changes from SLEHA
   11 to SLEHA 11 SP1 </remark>

  <para>
   With &sls; 11, the cluster stack has changed from &hb; to &ais;. &ais;
   implements an industry standard API, the Application Interface
   Specification (AIS), published by the Service Availability Forum. The
   cluster resource manager from &sls; 10 has been retained but has been
   significantly enhanced, ported to &ais; and is now known as Pacemaker.
  </para>

  <para>
   For more details what changed in the &ha; components from &slsreg; 10 SP2
   to &sls; 11, refer to the following sections.

     <term>Migration Threshold and Failure Timeouts</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       The &hasi; now comes with the concept of a migration threshold and
       failure timeout. You can define a number of failures for resources,
       after which they will migrate to a new node. By default, the node
       will no longer be allowed to run the failed resource until the
       administrator manually resets the resource’s failcount. However it
       is also possible to expire them by setting the resource’s
       <literal>failure-timeout</literal> option.

     <term>Support for Offline Configuration Changes</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Often it is desirable to preview the effects of a series of changes
       before updating the conﬁguration atomically. You can now create a
       <quote>shadow</quote> copy of the conﬁguration that can be edited
       with the command line interface, before committing it and thus
       changing the active cluster configuration atomically.

       The CIB now accepts XPath-based <literal>create</literal>,

     <term>Multi-dimensional Collocation and Ordering Constraints</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       For creating a set of collocated resources, previously you could
       either deﬁne a resource group (which could not always accurately
       express the design) or you could deﬁne each relationship as an
       individual constraint&mdash;causing a constraint explosion as the
       number of resources and combinations grew. Now you can also use an
       alternate form of collocation constraints by defining
       <literal>resource_sets</literal>.

     <term>Connection to the CIB From Non-cluster Machines</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       Provided Pacemaker is installed on a machine, it is possible to
       connect to the cluster even if the machine itself is not a part of
       it.

     <term>Triggering Recurring Actions at Known Times</term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       By default, recurring actions are scheduled relative to when the
       resource started, but this is not always desirable. To specify a
       date/time that the operation should be relative to, set the
       operation’s interval-origin. The cluster uses this point to
       calculate the correct start-delay such that the operation will occur
       at origin + (interval * N).

       All resource and cluster options now use dashes (-) instead of

       The cluster configuration is written in XML. Instead of a Document
       Type Definition (DTD), now a more powerful RELAX&nbsp;NG schema is
       used to define the pattern for the structure and content.
       <literal>libxml2</literal> is used as parser.

       Some ﬁelds (such as those in constraints that refer to resources)
       are IDREFs. This means that they must reference existing resources or
       objects in order for the conﬁguration to be valid. Removing an
       object which is referenced elsewhere will therefor fail.
