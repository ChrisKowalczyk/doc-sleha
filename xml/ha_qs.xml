  <para>
   After your cluster is installed and set up as described in
   <xref
   linkend="cha.ha.installation.yast"/> and you have learned how to
   configure resources either with the GUI or from command line, this
   chapter provides a basic example for the configuration of a simple
   resource: an IP address. It demonstrates both approaches to do so, using
   either the &hbgui; or the <command>crm</command> command line tool.
