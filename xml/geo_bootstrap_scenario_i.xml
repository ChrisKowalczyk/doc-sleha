  &geo; clusters based on &productname; can be considered
  <quote>overlay</quote> clusters where each cluster site corresponds to a
  cluster node in a traditional cluster. The overlay cluster is managed by
  the booth mechanism. It guarantees that the cluster resources will be
  highly available across different cluster sites. This is achieved by using
  cluster objects called tickets that are treated as failover domain between
  cluster sites, in case a site should be down. Booth guarantees that every
  ticket is granted to no more than one site at a time.

  Currently, the &geo; cluster bootstrap script only takes care of setting up
  booth and of creating the minimum set of resources that booth needs.

  the admin needs to execute before/after running the init scripts (in order
  to get a functioning geo cluster)?</remark>
