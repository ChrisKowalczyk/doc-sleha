 <title>Disaster Recovery with &rear;</title>
 <abstract>
  <para>
   &rear; (Relax and Recover) is an administrator tool-set for creating
   disaster recovery images. The disaster recovery information can either be
   stored via the network or locally on hard disks, USB devices, DVD/CD-R,
   tape or similar. The backup data is stored on a network file system
   (NFS).
  </para>

  <para>
   Keep in mind, &rear; needs to be configured and tested
   <emphasis>before</emphasis> any disaster happens. &rear; will not save
   you, if a disaster has already taken place.
  </para>
 </abstract>
 <warning>
  <title>Extensive Testing Required</title>
  <para>
   It is essential, whenever you create a rescue CD, to
   <emphasis>always</emphasis> test the disaster recovery with an
   <emphasis>identical</emphasis> test machine. Only if this procedure works
   satisfactorily, your disaster recovery system is correctly and reliably
   set up.
  </para>
 </warning>
 <warning>
  <title>No Version Upgrade for the &rear; Package</title>
  <para>
   &suse; does not deliver any updates for the &rear; package. It cannot be
   guaranteed that an existing &rear; disaster recovery set-up will still
   work after the upgrade.
  </para>
  <para>
   If you do a &rear; version upgrade on your own, carefully revalidate that
   your particular &rear; disaster recovery procedure still works.
  </para>

  <title>Preparing for the Worst Scenarios: Disaster Recovery Plans</title>

  <para>
   <emphasis>Before</emphasis> the worst scenario happens, take actions to
   prepare with a <emphasis>disaster recovery plan</emphasis>. A disaster
   recovery plan is a document where all risks, infrastructure, and the
   budget is being collected. Maybe you have already some plan in place, but

     <para>
      Conduct a solid risk analysis of your infrastructure. List all the
      possible threats and evaluate how serious they are. Determine how
      likely these threats are and prioritize them. It is recommended to use
      a simple categorization: probability and impact.

      The outcome of the analysis is an overview, which risks can be
      tolerated and which are critical for your business. Ask yourself, how
      can you minimize risks and how much will it cost. Depending on how big
      your company is, spend two to fifteen percent of the overall IT budget
      on disaster recovery.

              Examples would help or a reference to a source on how

  <title>Setting Up &rear;</title>

  <para>
   &rear; supports some backup tools (Tivoli Storage Manager, QNetix Galaxy,
   Symantec NetBackup, HP DataProtector) and can output its rescue medium to
   a CD or PXE environment. The restore step is possible through NFS or CIFS
   and other network file systems. Find more information in the manpage of
   &rear; (<command>man</command> <option>rear</option>).
  </para>

  <para>
   To use &rear; you need at least two identical systems: the main machine
   where your productive environment is stored and the test machine.
   <quote>Identical</quote> in this context means, for example, you can
   replace a network card with another one using the same Kernel driver. If
   a hardware component does not use the same driver, it is not considered
   identical by &rear;.
  </para>

  <para>
   &rear; can be used in different scenarios. The following example uses a
   NFS server as backup storage:
  </para>

  <procedure id="pro.ha.rear.nfs-server-backup">
   <title>Storing Your Backup on a NFS Server</title>

     Adapt the configuration file(s). Depending on how many servers you want
     to recover, use <filename>/etc/rear/site.conf</filename> for site-wide
     settings and <filename>/etc/rear/local.conf</filename> for
     machine-local settings. The following example uses a
     <filename>/etc/rear/local.conf</filename> configuration file. Replace
     the <option>NETFS_URL</option> with your own values. Further options
     are listed in the <citetitle>Various Settings</citetitle> section of
