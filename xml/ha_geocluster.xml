 <title>Multi-Site Clusters (Geo Clusters)</title>
 <remark>taroth 2011-10-06: DEVs, how is storage access solved in multi-site
  clusters? anything the cluster admin needs to check or configure? (with
  regards to storage?)</remark>
 <abstract>
  <para>
   Apart from local clusters and metro area clusters, &productnamereg;
   &productnumber; also supports multi-site clusters (geo clusters). That
   means you can have multiple, geographically dispersed sites with a local
   cluster each. Failover between these clusters is coordinated by a higher
   level entity, the so-called <literal>booth</literal>. Support for
   multi-site clusters is available as a separate option to &productname;.
   For details on how to use and set up multi-site clusters, refer to the
   &geoquick;.
