 <title>Cluster LVM</title>
 <abstract>
  <para>
  When managing shared storage on a cluster, every node must be informed
  about changes that are done to the storage subsystem. The Linux Volume
  Manager&nbsp;2 (LVM2), which is widely used to manage local storage, has been
  extended to support transparent management of volume groups across the
  whole cluster. Clustered volume groups can be managed using the same
  commands as local storage.

  <title>Conceptual Overview</title>
  <!--<para>
   Internally, cLVM uses the Distributed Lock Manager (DLM) component of the
   cluster stack to coordinate access to the LVM2 metadata. As DLM in turn
   integrates with the other components of the stack such as fencing, the
   integrity of the shared storage is protected at all times.

   <title>Creating a Cluster-aware Volume Group With DRBD</title>
   <step>
    <para>Create a primary/primary DRBD resource:</para>
    <substeps>
     <step>
      <para>Set up a DRBD device as primary/secondary first as described in
       <xref linkend="step.drbd.configure"/>. Make sure disk state is

     Check the locking type of LVM2 to be cluster-aware. 
    </para>
    <para>
     The file <filename>/etc/lvm/lvm.conf</filename> must contain the
     following line:

<screen>locking_type = 3</screen>
    <para>Write the configuration to disk. Copy this configuration to

   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Include the clvmd resource as a clone in the pacemaker configuration,
     and make it depend on the DLM clone resource. A typical snippet from
     the crm configuration shell would look like this:
    </para>
    <screen><command>primitive</command> dlm ocf:pacemaker:controld
<command>primitive</command> clvm ocf:lvm2:clvmd \
        params daemon_timeout="30"
<command>group</command> dlm-clvm dlm clvm
<command>clone</command> dlm-clvm-clone dlm-clvm \
        meta interleave="true" ordered="true"</screen>
    <para>
     Before proceeding, confirm that these resources have started
     successfully in your cluster. You may use <command>crm_mon</command> 
     or the GUI to check the running services.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Prepare the physical volume for LVM with the command
     <command>pvcreate</command>, for example on the device 
     <filename>/dev/sdb</filename>:
    </para>
<screen>pvcreate /dev/sdb</screen>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Create a cluster aware volume group:
    </para>
<screen>vgcreate --clustered y myclusterfs /dev/sdb</screen>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     Create logical volumes as needed. You may probably change the size
     (4G) of the logical volume. For example:
    </para>
<screen>lvcreate --name testlv -L 4G myclusterfs</screen>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     To ensure that the volume group is activated cluster-wide, configure a
     LVM resource as follows:
    </para>
<screen><command>primitive</command> vg1 ocf:heartbeat:LVM \
        params volgrpname="myclusterfs"
<command>clone</command> vg1-clone vg1 \
        meta interleave="true" ordered="true"
<command>colocation</command> colo-vg1 inf: vg1-clone clvm-clone
<command>order</command> order-vg1 inf: clvm-clone vg1-clone</screen>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     If you want the volume group to only be activated exclusively on one
     node, use the following example; in this case, cLVM will protect all
     logical volumes within the VG from being activated on multiple nodes,
     as an additional measure of protection for non-clustered applications:
    </para>
<screen><command>primitive</command> vg1 ocf:heartbeat:LVM \
        params volgrpname="myclusterfs" exclusive="yes"
<command>colocation</command> colo-vg1 inf: vg1 clvm-clone
<command>order</command> order-vg1 inf: clvm-clone vg1</screen>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     The logical volumes within the VG are now available as file system
     mounts or raw usage. Ensure that services using them must have proper
     dependencies to collocate them with and order them after the VG has
     been activated.
    </para>
   </step>
  </procedure>

  <para>
   After finishing these configuration steps, the LVM2 configuration can be
   done just like on any standalone workstation.
  </para>

 <sect1 id="sec.ha.clvm.drbd">
  <title>Configuring Eligible LVM2 Devices Explicitly</title>

  <para>
   When several devices seemingly share the same physical volume signature
   (as can be the case for multipath devices or drbd), it is recommended to
   explicitly configure the devices which LVM2 scans for PVs.
  </para>

  <para>
   For example, if the command <command>vgcreate</command> uses the physical
   device instead of using the mirrored block device, DRBD will be confused
   which may result in a split brain condition for DRBD.
  </para>

  <para>
   To deactivate a single device for LVM2, do the following:
  </para>

  <procedure>
   <step>
    <para>
     Edit the file <filename>/etc/lvm/lvm.conf</filename> and search for the
     line starting with <literal>filter</literal>.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     The patterns there are handled as regular expressions. A leading
     <quote>a</quote> means to accept a device pattern to the scan, a
     leading <quote>r</quote> rejects the devices that follow the device
     pattern.
    </para>
   </step>
   <step>
    <para>
     To remove a device named <filename>/dev/sdb1</filename>, add the
     following expression to the filter rule:
    </para>
<screen>"r|^/dev/sdb1$|"</screen>
    <para>
     The complete filter line will look like the following:
    </para>
<screen>filter = [ "r|^/dev/sdb1$|", "r|/dev/.*/by-path/.*|",<!--
 --> "r|/dev/.*/by-id/.*|", "a/.*/" ]</screen>
    <para>
     A filter line, that accepts DRBD and MPIO devices but rejects all other
     devices would look like this:
    </para>
<screen>filter = [ "a|/dev/drbd.*|", "a|/dev/.*/by-id/dm-uuid-mpath-.*|",<!--
--> "r/.*/" ]</screen>
   </step>
<!--   
   <step>
    <para>
     Explicitly accept all the eligible devices, and reject all others.
     For example, a filter line which accepts all MPIO and drbd devices would
     look like this:
    </para>
    <screen>filter = [ "a|/dev/drbd.*|", "a|/dev/.*/by-id/dm-uuid-mpath-.*|", "r/.*/"]</screen>
   </step> -->
   <step>
    <para>
     Write the configuration file and copy it to all cluster nodes.
