    The cluster information displayed in the <guimenu>Cluster

    need to decide which &hawk; instance you want to view the
    <guimenu>Cluster Dashboard</guimenu> on, and always use that one. The
    machine you are running &hawk; on does not even need to be part of
    any cluster for that purpose&mdash;it can be a separate, unrelated
    system.

<!--from bnc#808703:  
     Hawk's status screen is for viewing detailed status of one cluster (which is
     why you can't add other clusters to monitor when you're on the status screen).
     
     The dashboard is for showing summary details of many clusters, any of which you
     can click to get to the (more detailed) status screen showing that cluster
     only.
     
     You don't need to log in to hawk to visit the dashboard screen.  But you do
     need to be logged in to any clusters that are being viewed in the dashboard
     (since beta3 the dashboard will prompt for login details for each monitored
     cluster if you're not already logged in).  This is probably where the confusion
     starts.  That and the fact that any Hawk instance can also show a dashboard...
     
     It might help to look at it this way.  Assume you have two clusters (c0 and
     c1), and happen to have a separate unrelated system running Hawk, which you
     only use for its dashboard functionality (in fact there doesn't even need to be
     a cluster running on that system at all).  If you view the dashboard on that
     system, you don't need to log into hawk on that node, as you're not interested
     in that system itself - you just want to use its dashboard to monitor clusters
     c0 and c1.-->
