  &productnamereg; is an integrated suite of open source clustering
  technologies that enables you to implement highly available physical and
  virtual Linux clusters. For quick and efficient configuration and
  administration, the &hasi; includes both a graphical user interface (GUI)
  and a command line interface (CLI).
 </para>
 <para>
  This guide is intended for administrators who need to set up, configure,
  and maintain &ha; (HA) clusters. Both approaches (GUI and CLI) are covered
  in detail to help the administrators choose the appropriate tool that
  matches their needs for performing the key tasks.

     Before starting to install and configure your cluster, make yourself
     familiar with cluster fundamentals and architecture, get an overview of
     the key features and benefits, as well as modifications since the last
     release. Learn which hardware and software requirements must be met and
     what preparations to take before executing the next steps. Perform the
     installation and basic setup of your HA cluster using &yast;.

     Add, configure and manage resources, using either the GUI or the
     <command>crm</command> command line interface. Learn how to make use of
     load balancing and fencing. In case you consider writing your own
     resource agents or modifying existing ones, get some background
     information on how to create different types of resource agents.

     &productname; ships with a cluster-aware file system (Oracle Cluster
     File System, OCFS2) and volume manager (clustered Logical Volume
     Manager, cLVM). For replication of your data, the &hasi; also delivers
     DRBD (Distributed Replicated Block Device) which you can use to mirror
     the data of a high availability service from the active node of a
     cluster to its standby node.
